SOCIAL,22,F,Manchester,Student,No,N/A,Wanted to try something new to relieve stress,"I liked the community feel, I liked having others ‘pledging’ to join in, I liked naming the schedules because it gave them a purpose.","I think I would have liked there to be an alarm or reminder system in place once you had scheduled, or a way to link it to your phone’s calendar so there was a way of being reminded. I’m very forgetful.",2,4,,4,4,3,3,3,4,5,4,
SOCIAL,24,M,Cardiff,Student,Yes,More,Trying to make meditation a habit + feeling bad when I forgot!,"Easy to log meditations, quite interesting to see other people’s logs on the home page",Couldn’t see past meditations – and as I tended to forget to log them sometimes couldn’t remember whether or not I’d put sessions online,3,N/A,I only actually realised I could create schedules a couple of weeks ago,1,1,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,5,2,"Considering the impact that seeing other people’s sessions had, if I’d been more involved with the scheduling stuff I could see it being a big motivator.  Unfortunately, due to poor observation on my part, by the time I realised I could create my own/join others’ schedules I already had an internal 'schedule' I was using."
SOCIAL,24,F,Bath,Student,Yes,More,To relax and focus,Yes – enjoyed attending scheduled practise,Didn’t have a phone for two weeks to had to access it from my laptop – would have preferred to use it on my phone,3,5,,N/A,4,N/A,4,4,N/A,5,4,A way to encourage/kudos other participants on their practice would have been interesting
SOCIAL,46,F,Cambridge,FE College Manager,Yes,More,Wanting to meditate for its positive health giving and de-stressing properties.,"I liked the look of it, it was intuitive and easy to use. It helped me to meditate much more than I had ever managed before. I liked being part of a community.","No, but some suggestions for enhancing the application eg adding a reminder feature or a link to add a calendar event to create a reminder.",3,4,Very proud of myself for managing to do so much in the last few weeks. I think I will be much more likely to carry on.,4,3,4,5,4,5,4,4,The schedules I pledged to join were limited by my availability at that time. If I pledged to join a schedule I felt more motivated to complete the meditation because I didn't want to let people down
SOCIAL,23,F,Bristol,Piano Teacher,Yes,More,I wanted to experiment with meditation more,"Yes. I’ve never managed to regularly meditate before, unless as part of Yoga practise, but have managed to dedicate time specifically to meditation several times a week during the study.",No,4,5,,4,4,4,5,5,5,5,N/A,"I found the interaction with other participants really helpful. It did make me want to meditate at times when others would be meditating, and although this was often not possible because of timings, seeing other participants schedules and activity on the feed definitely made it easier for me to motivate myself to meditate."
SOCIAL,23,M,Bristol,Student,Yes,More,I wanted to meditate more,"Yes, I like being able to schedule meditations and to see the activity of others - v. encouraging!",No,3,5,,4,3,4,5,5,N/A,5,5,
CONTROL,22,F,Bristol,HR Manager,Yes,Less,To relax and feel less stressed,"When I did find time to sit and meditate for a few minutes, it made a massive difference to my day","Feeling stressed when I couldn't find the time to meditate...which made me more stressed, and the online app made me feel even more stressed because it was a reminder that I hadn't been able to do it.",2,4,If it could be linked to a phone or could be created as an app which could send you reminders with encouraging messages it would help!,,,,,,,,,
CONTROL,51,F,Tauton,CEO of Charity,Yes,More,Ideal opportunity to get more disciplined,Not really,"Yes – having to fill in dates etc to schedule and then to log – repetitive. This was fixed, however.",3,5,Would have been nice to join in with others in some way.,,,,,,,,,
CONTROL,24,M,Manchester,Barista,No,N/A,"Relaxation, de-stress, explore benefits of meditation",A pleasant and easy to use system that made me conscious of how much I was meditating - an awareness that helped me meditate more freqeuntly [sic].,I was expecting it to provide guidance on how to meditate which it did not.,3,4,"The online application helped me think more about when I would meditate yet, it increased the frequency with which I meditate. This increase has continued after the study. I expect to use the application more in the future and intend to start scheduling meditations.",,,,,,,,,
CONTROL,22,F,Bristol,Student,Yes,More,"Looking for general balance and maintain perspective, improved ability to get done the things I and the rest of the world need done [sic]","Just having the app in my favourites bar so I could see it functioned as a reminder to meditate, and scheduling sessions helped me to actually DO the meditation rather than put it off until the rest of the day's tasks were done.",No,3,4,,,,,,,,,,
SOCIAL,42,F,London,HR,Yes,More,I was curious to see what impact the app might have on my ability to form a practice,Yes – I enjoyed having access to the calendar to see what commitments were coming and it served as an excellent prompt and reminder to keep up with the plan.,I had some frustration around the copy/paste function to create more than one similar practice session. The study went across the time zone shift from GMT to BST and I found that I ended up manually changing the later spots more than once to try to get the time right.,2,5,"I do think the level of motivation was linked to knowing that this was a study, that the task was to use the app to support meditation and the sense that my completed activity was in some way being observed vs my commitment to act. I suspect that over time and if not observed or the sense of being observed diminished, then I would feel less strongly about completing my commitments – but I still expect that it would be a useful tool to support a programme of activity.",4,4,3,4,4,N/A,5,5,There was less interaction than I was expecting.
